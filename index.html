        <p id="goalp">Our mission is to connect medical offices and medical missions by collecting unwanted supplies and expired medications. By providing these resources to medical missions, we aim to improve their medical results and make a positive impact in economically challenged nations. Donations from medical offices are crucial as these nations often struggle to meet their healthcare needs.<br>To achieve our goal, we reach out to medical offices, explaining our mission and requesting their assistance. Once they agree to contribute, we will collect and categorize the donated items to ensure their suitability for medical missions. It is vital we check each and every expired medication and make sure they are within the guidelines of the area we are donating to. We will establish partnerships with reputable medical missions or organizations working in economically challenged areas to distribute these resources effectively.<br>Logistics and shipping arrangements will be carefully managed to ensure the safe and timely delivery of the donated items. Regular communication with medical missions and the communities they serve will help us understand their specific needs and assess the impact of our donations.<br>Maintaining strong relationships with medical offices and medical missions is crucial for ongoing support.  Through our efforts, we aim to bridge the healthcare gap and improve access to quality healthcare in economically challenged nations.</p>

        <hr id="hihhr">
        <p id="hihmp">This is the behind-the-scenes process that takes place every time we collect new<br>medications or supplies.</p>

        <img class="hihimg" src="collectionmed.png" alt="Collection">
        <h4>Collection</h4>
        <p class="hihp">It starts with us contacting medical offices. We also reach out to clinics for supplies. Once they agree to help our cause, we proceed. We arrange a time for collection. Our team then gathers the supplies. This collaborative effort ensures we have what we need.</p>

       <div class="hihdown"> 
        <img class="hihimg" src="inventorymed.png" alt="Inventory">
        <h4>Inventory</h4>
        <p class="hihp">We check the expiration date on each medication. This ensures they are within the guidelines of the medical mission. We also verify compliance with the area's donation guidelines. Every medication is inspected thoroughly. This process helps maintain safety and effectiveness. Our careful review ensures all donations meet the required standards.</p>

        <img class="hihimg" src="delivermed.png" alt="Distribution">
        <h4>Distribution</h4>
        <p class="hihp">We donate the supplies to different missions. These missions then distribute the items to underdeveloped regions. Another option is for us to deliver those supplies firsthand. We visit villages and areas in need. This allows us to directly see the impact. It also ensures the supplies reach their intended destination.</p>
